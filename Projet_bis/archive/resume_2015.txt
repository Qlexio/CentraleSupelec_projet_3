SiteEUI(kBtu/sf)
Description: Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Site Energy Use divided by its gross floor area. Site Energy Use is the annual amount of all the energy consumed by the property on-site, as reported on utility bills. Site EUI is measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.
25
SiteEUIWN(kBtu/sf)
Description: 	
Weather Normalized (WN) Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's WN Site Energy divided by its gross floor area (in square feet). WN Site Energy is the Site Energy Use the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions. WN Site EUI is measured in measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.
26
SourceEUI(kBtu/sf)
Description: Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Source Energy Use divided by its gross floor area. Source Energy Use is the annual energy used to operate the property, including losses from generation, transmission, & distribution. Source EUI is measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.
27
SourceEUIWN(kBtu/sf)
Description: Weather Normalized (WN) Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's WN Source Energy divided by its gross floor area. WN Source Energy is the Source Energy Use the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions. WN Source EUI is measured in measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.

GHGEmissions(MetricTonsCO2e)
Description: The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This calculation uses a GHG emissions factor from Seattle CIty Light's portfolio of generating resources. This uses Seattle City Light's 2015 emissions factor of 52.44 lbs CO2e/MWh. Enwave steam factor = 170.17 lbs CO2e/MMBtu. Gas factor sourced from EPA Portfolio Manager = 53.11 kg CO2e/MBtu. 
37
GHGEmissionsIntensity(kgCO2e/ft2)
Description: 	
Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions divided by property's gross floor area, measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot. This calculation uses a GHG emissions factor from Seattle City Light's portfolio of generating resources
